helping to improve the sourcing of job vacancies

## Project Scenario

The team at the recruitment agency is trying to improve its sourcing of job vacancies. To do this the agency relies on multiple job posting sites to identify potential job openings for its clients. However, manually searching through each site is time-consuming and often leads to missed opportunities.  

we analyze the data using web scraping tools that can automatically extract job posting data from multiple job posting sites.  The team will use your analysis to provide a more efficient way to provide job vacancies to better serve its clients. This feature will help the recruitment agency by getting relevant openings to their clients more quickly, giving their clients a competitive advantage over other applicants.

## Project Objectives
- Increase the efficiency of job vacancy sourcing
- Improve the quality of job vacancy sourcing  
- Gain a competitive advantage
